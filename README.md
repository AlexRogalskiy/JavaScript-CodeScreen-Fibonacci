# JavaScript-CodeScreen-Fibonacci
Example CodeScreen JavaScript (Node.js) assessment that requires the candidate to return the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

The sequence is assumed to be 0-indexed, with fibonacci(0) returning 0 and fibonacci(1) returning 1.

The class to write this method in is [fibonacci.js](fibonacci.js).

The tests that are run and are visible to the candidate are located in [tests/fibonacci.test.js](tests/fibonacci.test.js).

The tests that are run and are not visible to the candidate are located in [tests/fibonacci.hidden.test.js](tests/fibonacci.hidden.test.js).
